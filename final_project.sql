The scroll is tilted diagonally on a white stone cube, its central axis cut through. Some common names of Jews who perished in the Holocaust, as well as the numbers tattooed on their arms, are burnt and engraved on the body of the scroll. The scroll is perched on a stone base at a precarious angle, hovering between taking off and crashing. The sculpture is designed to incorporate fire and water, which trickles down the two inner sides of the stone, like tears. Encircling the base of the sculpture are the words of President Chaim Weizmann, in Yiddish, spoken at a Zionist Congress. Dani Karavan was born in Tel Aviv in 1930. He studied art with Aharon Avni, Avigdor Stematsky, Yehezkel Streichman, and Marcel Janco. He continued his studies at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem with Mordechai Ardon, and at the Academy of Fine Arts in Florence. He has represented Israel at numerous international exhibitions, among them the Venice Biennale, the Kassel Documenta, and the Sao Paulo Biennale, and has been named a UNESCO Artist for Peace.

The majority of Graetz’s sculptures are made of stainless steel and bronze and designed in aerodynamic shapes. This sculpture faithfully represents the artist, who formulated an abstract but understandable artistic language that is neither provocative nor aggressive but, rather, elegant and somewhat sterile – in keeping with cultural progress. The sculpture’s metallic sheen gives it an inner radiance. The work was donated to the Weizmann Institute by the sculptor in memory of his late father, Heinz R. Graetz, one of the pioneers of Israeli navigation and a founder of the Dizengoff shipping company. Gidon Graetz was born in Tel Aviv in 1929. He grew up on Kibbutz Beit-Alpha and fought in the Palmach in battles over Jerusalem. He studied at the Florence Academy of Art and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Since 1965 Graetz has been living in Florence. Weizmann Institute Board member Ayala Zacks-Abramov is the artist’s aunt.'),

The leaves have serrated edges and small hairs sprouting from their undersides. The Mount Tabor oak sheds its leaves late in the winter and sprouts new growth early in the spring; some specimens may not shed their leaves at all. The Mount Tabor oak is at its most beautiful when in bud, covered with a greenish-gold coat of new leaves and flowers. The acorns, which develop out of the flowers, are larger than those of other oak species, and the large cupules (cups) that hold them have long, curly protrusions. When roasted, the acorns can be used to make a coffee-like beverage, and the cupules are used for decoration. There are approximately 600 species of oak. Most of these are native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, but the Mount Tabor oak (or as it is called in the Bible, alon habashan) grows wild only in Israel and in Syria, on both sides of the Syrian-African rift. In the past, it covered vast portions of the Land of Israel. Ancient specimens, hundreds of years old, are scattered from the Golan Heights to the Sharon. Mount Tabor oaks have been planted at different times along the Institute’s Marcus Sieff Boulevard; future plans include creating a continuous strip of them along this route.'),

It belongs to the complex of buildings by Mendelsohn in this part of the campus. Located on the northern side, it, together with the Daniel Wolf Building across the walkway, creates an entrance gate to the Mendelsohn complex. While a certain symmetry of size exists in their façades, producing the impression of a gateway, the two buildings are opposed in the design of their windows. The windows of the Daniel Wolf Building that face the road are rectangular, although one large window on the side is round, in line with the “inverted ship” design. In contrast, the front windows of the Helen and Martin Kimmel Center for Archaeological Science facing the road are round, while those that face the adjacent building are square.'),

A mature tree can continue to grow in this manner, eventually turning into an entire grove of trunks. The area covered by such a tree can reach more than a kilometer, and it may provide shade to thousands of people. The bark on the trunks and branches is fairly smooth. The green leaves are large and thick with yellow veins. New leaves appear in a bronze color. The flowers are small figs that ripen into beautiful red fruit growing in pairs among the leaves. The Indian banyan is the national tree of India and is considered holy there. Because of its size, the Indian banyan has garnered much interest as an ornamental tree in warm regions throughout the world. It has been grown in Israel for a long time. A large, famous example presides over the garden at Mikveh Israel, while others can be found in Ein Gedi and in kibbutz landscaping in the Beit She’an Valley.'),

The figures of the king and queen are made up of basic modular components assembled on their axes and give the illusion that they can be opened and closed, even though in reality they cannot move. The crowns of the royal couple resemble horns, hinting at Etrog’s interest in Native American culture, while their mechanical shape suggests technological robots. Etrog uses a complex visual vocabulary to explore the forces shaping our time, such as the tension between technology and the living world. The artist donated the sculpture to the Weizmann Institute in memory of Samuel J. Zacks’s widow Ayala. Sorel Etrog was born in Romania in 1933 and immigrated to Israel with his family in 1950. He studied at the Avni Institute under Yehezkel Streichman, Marcel Janco, Moshe Mokady, and Moshe Sternschuss, among others, and has created projects in collaboration with Eugène Ionesco, Samuel Beckett, Marshall McLuhan and John Cage. His works are exhibited in modern art museums in New York and Paris, in important galleries in London, and in numerous private collections. Etrog lives in Canada.'),
(7, 6, 'Maurice and Gabriela Goldschleger Life Sciences Library', 34.8089, 31.9069, 65, 4.3, NULL, 'The Maurice and Gabriela Goldschleger Life Sciences Library, designed by the architect Yakov Rechter in 1991, attracts immediate attention by its unusual conical shape. This building is typical of Rechter, who always sought new ways and means of expression, while staying faithful to such veteran heavy materials as stone and concrete. Examples of his work include the Mivtahim Inn in Zichron Ya’akov built on a cliff in 1968, the Performing Arts Center built in Tel Aviv in 1994 and the enormous Holiday Inn dome on Ashkelon beach built in 1998. Here, too, Rechter was able to give free expression to his creative style, as this is a library rather than a research building with complicated engineering requirements. The smooth white concrete roof is supported by exposed concrete columns and beams that create a conical frame, gray and prominent. In contrast, slender, round, white steel columns on the front façade support the ceiling of the reading hall and the floor of the inner gallery, thus preserving the integrity of the glass front wall. To stress its uniqueness and secure the quiet appropriate to a library, the building is separated from the road by a protective moat, one floor deep, spanned by a bridge leading to the entrance door. The impressive exterior of the slanted roof, highlighted by its protruding concrete beams, is continued inside the library in the form of air-conditioning pipes, illuminated by hidden lights in the low ceiling, that follow the lines of the beams. The library’s conical form creates an interesting internal space, in which the entrance floor serves mainly as an archive with seating areas along the transparent front wall, while the tall space in the center is taken up by an overlooking gallery floor that serves mainly as a reading area. The space in the center is filled with ceilingless rooms with round windows, used for meetings and study. The upper gallery is accessed by a concrete staircase with a transparent roof. An additional glass wall in the center of the cone faces a small internal garden. This garden and the planted moat together enfold the building in a swathe of vegetation that serves to somewhat soften the harshness of Rechter’s favored concrete.'),
(9, 2, 'Olive', 34.8095, 31.9043, 24, 3.9, NULL, 'A tree with deep roots in human civilization, the olive tree is a small- to medium-sized evergreen. Its trunk is gray and smooth, and as it ages, it gains its characteristic knots and twists. Very old trunks may lose their heartwood, becoming hollow. The stiff, elongated leaves are dark gray on top and silver on the underside, so that the tree changes color with every gust of wind. Clusters of small white flowers appear on the tree in spring, and the oil-filled fruits that replace them are what have assured the tree its place in history. The Oleaceae family includes a number of plants that are not at all similar to the olive, including such flowering shrubs as lilac and jasmine. The genus Olea includes approximately 20 species, almost all of them native to Africa, Asia and Australia. The olive tree is the only one of these whose native region abuts Europe, hence its scientific name. The tree grows wild in the eastern Mediterranean and western Asia. The domesticated growth of the olive in this region began thousands of years ago and spread throughout the world. The olive is one of the seven species of the Land of Israel mentioned in the Bible, and was one of the three economic bases of biblical Israel: “grain, wine, and oil” (olive oil). The tree is often mentioned in the Bible as being beneficial, honored and valued. In Israel, there are olive trees known to be hundreds of years old or more, and some are claimed to be 2,000 years old. The olive tree also has a prominent place in other cultures and religions that have developed in this region. The olive branch has become a universal symbol of peace and appears in the United Nations emblem as well as in the emblem of the State of Israel, where it is the national tree.'),
(10, 4, 'Semaphore', 34.8178, 31.9081, 35, 3.5, NULL, 'Semaphore belongs to the artist’s “Totems” series. The upward-thrusting sculpture is made of forged iron treated with a heavy industrial hammer. The sculpture’s title is derived from the signaling system used by navigators at sea and by train drivers. Columns have always formed the basis of architecture. At the outset they were linked to nature, to vegetation, and always to landscape. Here, the column is industrial and man-made, rebelling against divine nature. An additional contrast embodied in the sculpture sums up the Israeli experience: on the one hand closely tied to the West, on the other hand striving to be part of its immediate context, the Middle East. Igael Tumarkin, born in Germany in 1933, immigrated to Israel as a two-year-old. He was a student of Rudi Lehmann in 1954, and in the following year studied and worked with Bertolt Brecht in the Berliner Ensemble in East Berlin. Renowned as a sculptor, painter, writer, intellectual and rebel, Tumarkin fought for a break from the lyrical abstract and is known for his groundbreaking use of new materials. He has represented Israel at the Venice Biennale and the São Paulo Biennale. His works are exhibited in various cities in Israel, Germany, France, Spain, the former Czechoslovakia, Japan and the United States.'),
(11, 4, 'In Suspense', 34.8085, 31.905, 37, 4.6, NULL, 'In Suspense is related to the artist’s series of geometric-minimalist sculptures of the 1960 whose theme was dramatic tension. The sculpture, made of corten steel, looks like an open triangle standing on its head; a thin plate, to which a massive rectangular box is attached, extends from its apex. The work creates a disturbing feeling that at any moment the delicate, free-floating balance will be disrupted. This sculpture is connected to Kadishman’s 15-meter-high Elevation (1967), better known as “The Three Circles,” in front of Tel Aviv’s Mann Auditorium. Both sculptures are tilted at an impossible angle from which they threaten to collapse. The sculpture was donated to the Weizmann Institute of Science by Ephraim Ilin. Menashe Kadishman was born in Tel Aviv in 1937. He studied with sculptor Moshe Sternschuss, worked as a shepherd on two kibbutzim, then resumed the study of sculpture with Rudi Lehmann and at the St. Martin’s School of Art and the Slade School in London. His works are exhibited in numerous museums in Israel and abroad and he has represented Israel at many international exhibitions, including the Venice Biennale, the Kassel Documenta, and the Sao Paulo Biennale. Kadishman lives in Tel Aviv.'),
(12, 4, 'Ritual', 34.814, 31.9081, 22, 4, NULL, 'Ritual is dedicated to the memory of Amos de-Shalit, a prominent nuclear physicist and former Director-General of the Weizmann Institute. The sculpture consists of two unusually large pieces of white Carrara marble whose combined weight is seven tons. The two pieces lean against each other, like two people sharing a secret. Giorgi treats empty space like a structural element, equal in worth to massive material shapes. The sculpture’s placement in the middle of a pool provides a reflection that doubles its presence in the environment. The sculpture was donated to the Weizmann Institute by Adolfo Bloch, Brazil. Bruno Giorgi was born in Sao Paulo in 1905. In his youth he was arrested for participating in an anti-fascist movement. In the 1930s he had a studio in Paris, where he studied and worked with Aristide Maillol. In 1936 he joined the Spanish republican forces and took part in the Spanish Civil War. After Franco’s victory Giorgi returned to Brazil and devoted himself to sculpture. In the 1960s he created two large sculptural monuments of Carrara marble that were a milestone in the development and design of the city of Brasilia. Giorgi died in Rio de Janeiro in 1993.'),
(14, 7, 'Hermann and Dan Mayer Campus Guesthouse - Maison de France', 34.8106, 31.9065, 57, 3.9, NULL, 'The San Martin Faculty Clubhouse and the Hermann Mayer Campus Guesthouse – Maison de France (which was built later) were designed by the architects Arieh Sharon and Benjamin Idelson in 1959 as a two-story building. One of its floors temporarily housed the offices of the Institute’s administration. In 1966, when the administration moved to the Stone Building, the building was redesigned for use as a guesthouse by the architects Benjamin Idelson and Gershon Zippor, with interior design by Rafi Blumenfeld and Lazar Hizkiya. The redesign involved changes in the interior, the addition of a third floor to match the existing ones and, at a later stage, the opening of a second entrance on the northern side.   It is obvious from its appearance that the building was intended not for research or study but as a clubhouse and guesthouse. Its style, typical of guesthouses built during that period throughout Israel, reflects the socialist and communal spirit prevalent in the country at the time. The guest rooms are at the front of the building and have long, deep balconies that connect all the rooms on each floor and are separated by tall, prefabricated partitions. Helping to bear the weight of the balconies are slender, round steel columns that match the balconies’ iron balustrades. The entrance area has unusual concrete structures: round columns scrubbed to accentuate the large aggregate from which they were derived and hexagon-shaped outer tiles, whose net pattern matches that of the concrete entrance staircase.   The ground floor provides access from one side of the building to the other. At its center, a wide staircase leads up to the clubhouse, with a wide, double-height window through which southern light filters past climbing plants into the central space. Additional light enters the stairwell from the roof through a greenish glass elevator shaft that was constructed in 2002 by the architects Gershon and Barak Zippor. The building also houses one of the staff’s restaurants.'),

The leaves are usually arranged in whorls of three growing from a single point on the branch. The mature leaves are long and stiff, with edges that are only slightly serrated or not serrated (hence the scientific name, integrifolia: intact leaves). In spring, attractive inflorescences (clusters) of small white flowers develop, some of which are fertilized to produce globular fruits with a green husk that splits when ripe. Inside is a nut with a particularly hard shell and a seed or two. Prized for their buttery taste, macadamias have a high nutritional value; their oils are often used in cosmetics. There are nine species in the genus Macadamia, most of them from Australia, but only the fruits of the Macadamia integrifolia and the Macadamia tetraphylla are edible – the rest are poisonous. Commercial agricultural production of the macadamia began in the 19th century, and it is thought to be the only agricultural crop that originated in Australia. The macadamia was introduced into Israel in the 1950s; some of the first trees were planted in the experimental plot on the grounds of the Weizmann Institute.'),

Their thin necks with a few perky feathers add a further humorous touch to the sculpture. Sternschuss was one of the first Israeli sculptors to turn to the abstract. Since the mid-1950s, like his friends Dov Feigin and Yehiel Shemi in the avant-garde New Horizons Group, he has experimented with the motif of birds and the nest. These works are mostly built from industrial iron parts; but even when relying on clean geometrical structures like cylinders, spheres, and cones, a legacy of Cubism, his works retain a strong link to human beings and the living world. Moshe Sternschuss was born in Poland in 1903 and immigrated to Israel in 1926. He studied at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem, then at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. In 1948 he was among the founders of the New Horizons Group. He headed the sculpture department of the Avni Institute in Tel Aviv and was a senior lecturer on sculpture at the university of Haifa. His sculptures are exhibited in numerous public institutions in Israel, and in useums in Israel and abroad. Sternschuss died in Tel Aviv in 1992.'),

It is prized for its lush red and orange bloom in summer; at its height, the tree appears to “burn” like a flame, hence the common name, flamboyant. The tree has a wide canopied shape, reminiscent of the acacia tree of the Negev; hence the tree’s Hebrew name comes from tze’ela, the biblical name for acacia. The royal poinciana’s trunk and primary branches have an impressive structure, which is apparent when it is bare in winter. Its root system is shallow and sometimes protrudes above ground. Its large bipinnate (twice-compound) leaves have very small, deep green leaflets. The foliage is usually shed in winter, with new leaf growth occurring late, at the end of spring. After the spectacular bloom, large dark, flat woody pods develop. The royal poinciana is native to Madagascar, where it is endangered; but as an ornamental tree it thrives in warm, tropical countries. It was introduced into Israel in the 1920s. It grows most successfully in the Jordan Valley and the Arava, where it blooms in flaming red. In other valleys and on the coastal plain, its success depends on local conditions.'),

Numerous dense branches with brown bark grow from the base of the trunk. The round, wide crown is made up of very large, round leaves, each with several pointed lobes. The leaves are somewhat hairy and have a “rumpled” look. In winter, huge, showy, ball-like inflorescences (flower clusters) made up of numerous bright pink flowers hang among the leaves. The tree stays in bloom well into the spring. The clusters continue to hang, even when the flowers have wilted and turned brown. As far as is known, the plant does not produce fruit in Israel. The genus Dombeya belongs to the Sterculiaceae family, and includes over 200 species from southern and eastern Africa, and Madagascar. The derivation of the Mexican rose that is generally found in Israel is unclear. It is known by various names in different sources, and it may possibly be a cross between a few similar species. In Israel, the Mexican rose is primarily found in older gardens.'),

Its axial trunk extends all the way up to its crown, with secondary branches branching out horizontally. The needles, arranged in bundles of three, hang downwards. The contrast between its upright profile and its soft, drooping foliage distinguishes the Canary Island pine from other pine species and gives it its characteristic shape. The Canary Island pine is exclusively endemic to the Canary Islands, where it is uniquely adapted to a climate with variable precipitation patterns. It traps moist ocean air in its foliage, and its drooping needles direct the drops of condensation to the ground below. Hence, it plays a significant role in maintaining the water balance of its habitat. The Canary Island pine is valued in carpentry, and, due to its ability to grow quickly and its tolerance to heat and drought, it has become a preferred species for afforestation in many countries. This tree is one of the few pines that can regenerate after a fire or being cut down. Due to its vulnerability to caterpillars of the pine processionary moth, however, it is not widely used in Israel.'),

Meyer Weisgal, Weizmann’s assistant concentrated on raising the funds for the soon-to-be Weizmann Institute of Science which would also include the Daniel Sieff research Institute. In the same year the American Committee for the Weizmann Institute of Science was established in order to support Chaim Weizmann’s research and eventually, it was the members of this committee who assisted in raising the funds for the establishment of the Institute.                        So it was decided in the year of 1949 and with the agreement of the Sieff family to establish the Weizmann Institute of Science. At the time of its foundation the building included the departments of biophysics, polymeric research, isotopes research, applied mathematics, optics and the Institute’s Administration. In here the first electronic department in Israel was established. Some Title For Test At the entrance of the building the giant computer “Weizac” is placed. The WEIZAC (Weizmann Automatic Computer) was the first computer in Israel, and one of the first large-scale, stored-program, electronic computers in the world.                                                                      The building was designed by the architects Arieh Elhanani, Israel Dicker and Uriel Schiller in 1947; a new wing was added to the back of the building in 1960. Planned according to a sketch by Erich Mendelsohn, the building’s general structure is monumental and official looking, while its repeating office windows project a no-nonsense functionality.                                                                                        The accentuated entrance, the wide staircase and the barrel-vaulted ceiling covering the entire lobby create a feeling of majestic splendor. This entrance served as the stage from which Dr. Chaim Weizmann, David Ben-Gurion, Golda Meir and others delivered speeches at the dedication of the Weizmann Institute of Science. In contrast to the flat, functional façade modestly faced with light-colored plaster, the entrance is accentuated by a stone handrail, with glass-and-iron Modernist lamps on either side and an impressive stone frame around the entrance door. The door itself has been artistically crafted as a network of double iron grills with iron protrusions at their intersections. The inner doors, leading from the entrance lobby to corridors with rooms on both sides, are similarly fashioned and are framed in the same brown marble as that used for the floor tiles. Incorporated in the ceiling are glass bricks to admit natural light, and embedded on the underside of the upper-floor balconies are large round lamps.          The double-rod balustrade and handrail lining the wide staircase to the upper floor are of copper rather than plain iron. Even the baseboard is of 20-cm high brown marble tiles, almost three times the standard height.                                                                                                 The air-conditioning system, designed when the building was constructed, it was renown as the first air-conditioned building in the Middle East.  '),

The design was dictated by the building’s function: the study of the environment. This is a “green” building; it embodies the principle of sustainability: preserving a balance between society and the environment, to the detriment of neither, while taking heed of the future. Green construction standards now exist throughout the world, the most famous being the U.S. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) system, which served as a guide for the 2005 Israeli standard for green buildings. That standard defines a variety of criteria: the use of environmentally friendly materials (recycled or stemming from renewable resources), energy-saving measures and waste management. A number of green components are readily apparent on the exterior of the Sussman Building: the vegetation that surrounds the building, sun-deflecting grids for keeping the glass cool and planted areas in the central patio of the building and on the roofs, including a flat roof with greenhouses for absorbing hot air and channeling it into the air-conditioning ducts that also heat the rooms in winter. About a dozen different technologies for saving electricity were implemented in the building. The seminar room has ceiling fans that reduce the need for air-conditioning; the labs have pale-colored windowsills that reflect light into the interior. Electricity circuits for areas close to the windows have been separated from those situated in the depths of the building, where illumination is not aided by sunlight.  The architect Dagan Mochly was responsible for the interior design of the building, including the labs. These labs have fume hoods, the first of their kind in Israel, that slow down when there is no movement in the room and work in coordination with the air-conditioning system to prevent cooled air from leaking through the hood. A cylindrical chimney makes it possible to release fumes to the atmosphere safely, at a relatively great height. Finally, all the furniture and materials used for interior decoration are environmentally friendly.  The building consumes 50% less energy compared with regular labs.

This design belongs to a period influenced by the first achievements in space, by pop music and by the props of science fiction films (such as the futuristic but real home in which Woody Allen’s Sleeper was filmed in 1973). At the time, architectural groups and movements were searching for new ways of expression that would diverge from straightforward, “dry” Modernism. Most famous among these was the Archigram Group, which designed structures so futuristic and radical they were never built. These included transportable buildings with legs and a city whose parts could be removed or added. The accelerator at the Weizmann Institute of Science is clearly related to the Einstein Tower, a solar observatory in Potsdam, Germany, built in the early 1920s by Erich Mendelsohn, the famous architect whose name is inextricably linked with the Weizmann Institute.  In the 1970s, the accelerator enabled Weizmann Institute scientists to work at the forefront of world science.

The dark, exquisite heartwood is in great demand for high-quality, high-end carpentry, and the industry name for the wood – rosewood – is also the name of the tree. The tree is native to northern India where, in winter, the tree sheds its leaves. These are pinnate with three to five leaflets that are round with a prominent sharp point. In Israel, only during especially cold winters does the tree shed all of its leaves; otherwise only some or none of the leaves fall. In spring, its small, fragrant yellowish-cream flowers attract honeybees. After the tree blooms, small, flat pods develop. In the past, rosewood was planted in groves and boulevards throughout Israel, but due to improper care and over-pruning, many of the trees withered or became twisted. In contrast, rosewood trees that have grown undisturbed have established themselves, becoming large and impressive trees. At the Weizmann Institute, rosewood trees grow along the length of Marcus Sieff Boulevard.'),

The dark-shaded glass not only conceals what is happening indoors; it also hides the divisions and levels of the building. The entrances to the building, accentuated by striking yellow and red paint, stand out from the simple black glass box. At the main entrance, a yellow metal pyramid directs visitors to the Department of Science Teaching and to the side entrance of the Feinberg Graduate School. Red paint covers the aluminum jamb of the entrance door and the round column in the “missing” corner on the ground floor of the building, which creates a roofed entrance space and breaks up the perfect box. The Department of Science Teaching at the Weizmann Institute was created in 1968 by Professor Amos De Shalit. It is a full-fledged academic department whose main mission is to advance the field of science and mathematics education at large, and to impact science and mathematics education in Israel.

Kimmelman Building is, in essence, an extension of the Ernst David Bergmann Institute, a four-story concrete structure designed by the architect Moshe Harel in 1963. In 1994, two floors were added to it, becoming the Kimmelman Building, jointly designed by the architects Gershon and Barak Zippor, Zadok Sherman and Shmuel Potash. Its façades were refaced with a large, modern screen wall of bluish greenish glass that covers the entire side facing the street, except the ground floor. The glass used in this wall is reflective rather than transparent, and its relative opacity turns it into a one way mirror on the outside, making it possible to cover the entire building – from the windows to such solid parts as the walls and the concrete floor – in a uniform manner. The resultant appearance is misleading: Rather than revealing to the outside observer what is happening inside the building during the day, the glass turns into a mirror, keeping the building’s interior a mystery. At night, the mirror is reversed: a person inside the building can hardly see the outdoors, while those on the outside can see everything that is happening within the lit rooms. The building, however, is used mainly during the day, preserving the workers’ privacy, while the bushes and the tall cypress trees in the garden are reflected and duplicated in the glass.   This innovative technology immediately became a great hit; buildings of this type can be seen in office areas and high-tech industrial parks throughout Israel. In the Kimmelman Building, the architects, for practical and design reasons, have used granite and granite porcelain tiles to cover the concrete protrusions of the extension cables that reinforced the existing building, making it possible to add the two floors. In the entrance lobby, the designers have also used glass – here as a covering to the building’s frame; but this time the glass is transparent, with turquoise inscriptions matching the color of the glass outside. Molded to a rounded shape, the glass serves as a plaque covering the building’s two main columns at the entrance. The reddish floor tiles of the lobby are reminiscent of the exterior stone facing, while the delicate shades of turquoise in the wall painting by David Kedem and Amiram Shamir echo the greenish screen wall.'),

Aerial roots may grow downwards from the primary branches and along the trunk. When the tree matures, a weave of surface roots develops at the base of the trunk. This contributes to the tree’s beauty, but also endangers nearby paving and foundations. The bark is quite smooth and pale gray. The leaves are small, oval and glossy (one of its earlier names in Hebrew was Ficus notzetz, shiny ficus). The leaves are dark green; new, pale green leaves stand out against the dark green background, giving the tree a youthful look.  When the tree blooms, small green figs develop on the branches. Tiny wasps particular to this Ficus species pollinate them so that they ripen and soften. These wasps arrived in Israel only in the last few decades of the 20th century. The ripe figs attract birds and fruit bats, leading to a decrease in the use of the tree in recent years. The Indian laurel fig has a wide natural distribution: India, Sri Lanka, southern China, Malaysia, Indonesia, northern Australia and New Caledonia.

The Institute, which gave rise to the Weizmann Institute of Science, was established in 1934 on the initiative of Dr. Chaim Weizmann. It was built with a donation from Israel and Rebecca Sieff, among the founders of the Marks & Spencer chain of Department stores, who wished to commemorate their son Daniel. The inscription in three languages – English, Hebrew and Arabic – on the front of the building testifies to Weizmann’s vision of peace, comradeship and joint enterprise between Jews and Arabs. The building was designed by Benjamin Chaikin. The logo on the building is the work of the noted Jewish architect Erich Mendelsohn and, to the best of our knowledge, typographer Francesca Baruch. Among the first scientists were a number of scientists who were forced to flee Nazi Germany. The main scientific activity was based on the pure scientific research and the research relating to the immediate needs of the evolving community in Israel. The scientific staff’s research efforts bore fruit to meaningful achievements in a national and global rate. The well-preserved building and its entrance are characteristic of the period, combining the International Style with typical Mediterranean elements. A striking example is the cornice of the building’s roof, pointed toward the center like a classical Greek pediment. A complicated system of protrusions and depressions emphasizes the cornice, the position of the entrance and the line of the upper and lower windows. The latter resemble the famous ribbon windows by the French architect Le Corbusier, one of the hallmarks of the International Style. Yet Chaikin, an Eretz-Israel architect, chose not to disconnect the columns from the wall, creating a ribbon window using depressions only. While the original wooden roll-down shades have not survived, the building’s central staircase is exceptionally well preserved and deserves to be an object of pilgrimage by historians, conservation architects and all nostalgia aficionados. Here one finds materials and decorations of a rare quality: light-gray Carrera marble for the floor with two black stripes running along the sides of the corridor; iron balustrades with geometrical straight lines and barred iron newel posts at the corners; and a stylized wooden handrail.                                 The iron entrance door is also the work of a master craftsman.

They chose to build their house on a hill near the Daniel Sieff Research Institute, founded by Chaim Weizmann in 1934. It was the first building designed by Mendelsohn in Israel, constructed in the Modernist International Style and referred to in popular parlance as “the palace,” due to its hilltop location and its size: It covers an area of 1,000 square meters and is surrounded by a 10-acre garden. The design of the house, influenced by Le Corbusier’s Villa Savoye, combines a number of International Style principles with design elements and materials that, at Weizmann’s request, were local, such as the Hebron-stone floors. The U-shaped structure is designed to surround a west-facing swimming pool, such that the sea breeze ripples the pool’s water and helps lower the temperature, as do the fountains and decorative pools of traditional Arab and Mediterranean construction. Traditional elongated doors lead to the swimming pool, which is flanked by two arcades of four columns each. Two of these columns on the western side support a flat roof. The building incorporates several naval motifs, including porthole windows on the side and, centered between the building’s two wings, a cylindrical structure, the stairwell of an imposing spiral staircase, which stands out like a captain’s command post. The building’s two wings also include a guest room on the northern side and a library recessed into the particularly thick southern wall, home to 1,200 books in six languages: Hebrew, English, Russian, German, French and Yiddish. Though the unique western façade has become the most recognizable hallmark of the Weizmann House, it is the southern side that contains the official entrance, projecting functional modesty and masking the splendor of the interior.            This modesty also characterizes the grave of Chaim and Vera Weizmann in the garden. The double tombstone was fashioned after the tombstones of missing soldiers in Great Britain, in memory of their son Michael, a Royal Air Force pilot whose plane was shot down over the Bay of Biscay in World War II. In 1999, the Weizmann House was renovated according to the design of architect Hillel Schocken. In 2016 the House underwent yet another restoration project which focused primarily on the house’s exterior and lasted 1 year.
